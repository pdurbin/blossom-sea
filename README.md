Blossom Sea
===========

Blossom Sea is a mobile HTML5 game by Erika and Phil Durbin in which [Blossom](https://github.com/pdurbin/blossom) continues her adventures underwater, dodging fish.

You can play the game at https://pdurbin.github.io/blossom-sea which should look something like the screenshot below:
